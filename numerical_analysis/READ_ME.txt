This was an assignment for my numerical analysis course.

The goal was to use the singular value decomposition to do image compression on a gray image, particularly by truncating the SVD.

Then we were to create an algorithm that splits the matrix into blocks and truncates them that way, minimizing error.

Throughout the assignment many plots were made of the results to get a better understanding of how everything was working.
